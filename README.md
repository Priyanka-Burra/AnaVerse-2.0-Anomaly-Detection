# AnaVerse-2.0-Anomaly-Detection

## Problem Statement
In sensor-based systems, abnormal readings (anomalies) can indicate faults, failures, or unusual behavior that may impact system performance and reliability.  
This project focuses on detecting such anomalies in sensor data using machine learning techniques as part of the AnaVerse 2.0 Kaggle Competition.

## Dataset
- **Source:** AnaVerse 2.0 Kaggle Competition dataset  
- **Type:** Sensor-based numerical data  
- **Description:** Contains sensor readings where abnormal patterns need to be identified  
- **Preprocessing:** Data cleaning, scaling, and normalization applied

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- **Algorithm:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for anomaly detection  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  

## Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle inconsistencies  
- Feature scaling and normalization for distance-based modeling  
- Applied K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to identify anomalous observations  
- Evaluated model performance and generated predictions  
- Prepared final output for Kaggle competition submission  

## Key Insights
- Distance-based models like KNN are effective for identifying abnormal sensor patterns  
- Proper feature scaling significantly improves anomaly detection performance  
- Preprocessing plays a critical role in detecting subtle anomalies in sensor data  

## Results
- Successfully built an end-to-end anomaly detection pipeline  
- Generated anomaly predictions for competition submission  
- Demonstrated a complete machine learning workflow from preprocessing to evaluation
