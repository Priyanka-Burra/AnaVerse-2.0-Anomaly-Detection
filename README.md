📊 AnaVerse 2.0 – Sensor Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning

An end-to-end machine learning project that detects abnormal sensor readings to improve system reliability and enable proactive fault detection.

🚀 Overview

This project focuses on identifying anomalies in sensor-based numerical data using machine learning techniques. Developed as part of the AnaVerse 2.0 Kaggle Competition, it simulates a real-world data science workflow—from raw data preprocessing to model implementation and prediction generation.

The final outcome is a robust anomaly detection pipeline capable of highlighting abnormal sensor patterns that may indicate system faults, failures, or unusual behavior.
